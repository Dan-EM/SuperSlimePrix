**Why fight when you can race?**
Welcome to a world where Adventurers and Monsters have settled their differences by riding on carts!
Thank you for taking the time to look at my project!

## Backlog
### Character models: 
- Team Monster: Slime, Lizard, Mushroom Kid
- Team Adventurer: Swordsman, Archer, Mage
- Slime will be the default character model

### Adjusted controls:
